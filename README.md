Spring roll Demo
================

Welcom to the Project Spring Roll Demo. This is an exploratory demo where we show you how the real deal could look like. The posts are made up and while you can perform certain things (e.g. add a new post or search), the data isn't saved anywhere - it's just a demo.

I'm a curious user
==================

If you just want to play around with our demo, check out the [live demo](http://famanson.com/_public/spring-roll-demo) and **send us feedback**. We try to push updates every 2 weeks until mid-July.
